    <p> The body contains the content of your page. It's like a document where you <br>
    use tags that define the layout, for example: headings, paragraphs, media such<br>
    as images and sound, links to other pages and sites, etc.. Here, we use the "p" tag <br>
    for paragraph. The "br" tag is for line breaks. Notice how "br" does not have a closing tag.</p>
    
    <p>This is a second pargraph. When using paragrphs, line breaks are added between paragraphs.<br>
      Within a paragraph,if you want line breaks you can use "br". What would happen if you did<br> n
      ot use "br"? If you want to preserve formatting without additional tags, you can use the "pre" tag. The <br> 
      text inside pre is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both<br> 
      spaces and line breaks. Following is an example.</p>
    
   <!-- everything in pre is displayed as is. Useful when showing code for example -->
    <pre>
Headings are a way to add a title and subtitles. There are 6 headings "h1" through "h6" 
where "h1" is most important and "h6" is least important. Margins are automatically
added before and after each heading. Note that the h1 tag is only used once, as the main
heading of the page. h2 to h6 can be used as often as desired, but they should
always be used in order.  Here is an example in action.</pre>
    
    <!-- heading tags -->
    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>Heading 2</h2>
    <h3>Heading 3</h3>
    <h4>Heading 4</h4>
    <h5>Heading 5</h5>
    <h6>Heading 6</h6>
