     <!-- bold vs strong -->
    <h2>bold vs strong</h2>
    <p>The "b" tag will bold the content between the tag. This is <b>bold</b>. The "strong" <br>
    tag will also bold the text, but has a different meaning on different devices. This is <strong>strong.</strong><br>Bold is a style but has no meaning to a blind person who can't see bold. strong is an indication of how something should be understood.<br> "Strong" could (and often does) mean "bold" in a browser but it could also mean a lower tone for a speaking program like Jaws (for blind people)<br> or be represented by an underline (since you can't bold a bold) on a Palm Pilot. You should use strong in favor of bold since it has more meaning.</p>
    
     <!-- italic vs emphasis -->
    <h2>italic vs emphasis</h2>
    <p>Similarly "i" will italicize text. This is <i>italicized.</i> "em" or emphasis will also italicize text. This is <em>emphasized.</em><br>Where as "i" just means italize text, "em" has additional meaning beyond just seeing italicized text in the browser. "strong" is "emphasis" but stronger. You should use "em" in favor of "i" for its additional meaning across devices.</p>
    
    <!-- subscript and superscript -->
    <h2>subscript and superscript</h2>
    <p>The HTML "sub" tag defines subscripted text. This is <sub>subscripted</sub> text.<br>
    The "sup" tag defines superscripted text. This is <sup>superscripted</sup> text.</p>
    
     <!-- unordered lists -->
    <h2>unordered lists</h2>
    <p>An unordered list starts with the "ul" tag. Each list item starts with the "li" tag.
     The list items will be marked with bullets by default. Here is an example.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>apples</li>
        <li>oranges</li>
        <li>pears</li>
    </ul>
    
     <!-- ordered lists -->
    <h2>ordered lists</h2>
    <p>An ordered list starts with the "ol" tag. Each list item starts with the "li" tag.
     The list items will be numbered by default. Here is an example.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>apples</li>
        <li>oranges</li>
        <li>pears</li>
    </ol>
    
    <!-- embedding unordered and ordered list -->
    <h2> embedding lists</h2>
    <p>Here we have an ordered list embedded withing an unordered list.</p>
